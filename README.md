Australian Climate Analytics (1970–2020)

Developed by Tanisha Sinha
Full-Stack Developer & Data Architect

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📌 Project Overview
Developed as a flagship project during my first semester of university, this Decision Support System (DSS) was engineered to bridge the gap between complex climate datasets and actionable insights. By integrating Python-driven analytics with a high-fidelity glassmorphism interface, the tool provides a seamless platform for researchers and planners to evaluate 50 years of historical Australian weather trends.

🚀 Key Features
Station Explorer: Access real-time data and historical summaries from across all Australian States and Territories.

• Temperature History: Dynamic line charts visualizing max temperature trends over time using Chart.js.
• Metric Viewer: Comparative bar charts for Total Rainfall, Rainy Days, and Extreme Heat records.
• Similarity Check: A pattern-matching engine that finds "climate twins" by comparing temperature profiles between different locations.
• Data Export: Custom CSV report generation allowing for offline analysis of temperature and precipitation data.

🛠️ Technical Stack

• Backend: Python / Flask
• Data Processing: Pandas / NumPy
• Database: SQLite3
• Frontend: HTML5 / CSS3 (Glassmorphism UI) / Lucide Icons
• Visualization: Chart.js
